Specifications:
	• This project is meant to practice acquired ‘conceptual knowledge’ about ‘Graphs’.
	• We implemented a “Program” to manage a set of vehicles communicating between each other – alike in ‘automotive cars’. Every vehicle is equipped with an ‘Antenna’ whose ‘Connectivity Range’ is given as input (in meters).
	• We assume that we know the exact position of every vehicle using GPS (Global Positioning System).

Implementation:
	• We adopted the ‘Adjacency List’ presentation.
	• We build the graph by reading from a text file (data.txt).


The data.txt file contains the following:	
number of cars;
connectivity radius/transmission range;
every following line contains:
	ID x-coordinate y-coordinate;
